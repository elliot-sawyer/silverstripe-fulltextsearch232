# FullTextSearch module

DON'T use this, hacked to work with Solr 5 and 6. Needs to be done properly!

Please take a fork/copy of this if you really need to use it in your project, repo will be deleted in future when
no longer needed by me. You have been warned.

Based on release 2.3.2 of the fulltext search module. Contains the delete fix which I need.

Thank you.
